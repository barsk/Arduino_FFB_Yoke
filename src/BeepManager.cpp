  For DIY projects involving electronic and electromechanical moving parts, caution is essential. 
  Ensure that you take the appropriate safety precautions, particularly when working with electricity. 
  Only work with devices if you understand their functionality and potential risks, and always wear 
  appropriate protective equipment. 
  Make sure you are working in a safe, well-lit environment, and that all components are properly installed and secured to avoid injury or damage.

  Special caution is required when building a force feedback device. Unexpected or sudden movements may occur, 
  which could lead to damage to people or other objects. 
  Ensure that all mechanical parts are securely mounted and that the work area is free of obstacles.
