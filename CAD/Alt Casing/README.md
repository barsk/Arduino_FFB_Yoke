# Alternative casing design
This folder holds an alternative casing design with a 10 mm thick board and a casing that is more "basic" for further tinkering. 
It is meant as a starting point for creating something out of sheet metal maybe and is not to consider a completed design. 

The board in itself has the screw holes lined up exactly the same as the standard 18 mm board and is perfectly usable for creating an aluminium 
CNC milled board for instance.
