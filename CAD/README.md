# CAD files

This directory contains mesh files (STL) for all parts. Some critical parts are also offered in STEP, to ease in remixing and tinkering. The Yoke Controller also has one 3MF file for the Console Front (Compartment lid) to make it possible to print the logo in color. 

Detailed guides for printing are found in the 3D Print pages of the Wiki.
