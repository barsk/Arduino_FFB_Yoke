# CAD files

This directory contains mesh files (STL) for all parts. Some critical parts are also offered in Fusion 360 format (.f3d) and STEP, to ease in remixing and tinkering. The Yoke Controller also has one 3MF file for the Console Front (Compartment lid) to make it possible to print the logo in color. 

Detailed guides for printing are found in the 3D Print pages of the Wiki.

> The AS5600 encoder bracket needs to be printed twice, one for each axis. There are two files for this STL, roll and pitch, as a reminder. They are identical though.
