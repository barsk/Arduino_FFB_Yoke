# Arduino_FFB_Yoke
Flightsim FFB Yoke with Arduino Micro Pro

## Fork with AS5600 magnetic encoders, minimized footprint andd enhanced pitch travel
This is a fork of the excellent Gagagu Arduino FFB Yoke project. I had some different goals in mind with smaller, cheaper and more accurate 
magnetic encoders. That also enables the possibility to minimize the footprint a considerable amount and increase pitch travel from about 120 mm to 160 mm.
Most of the 3D printed parts are modified in some aspect. The Arduino firmaware is also updated for the new encoders and TCA9548 I2C mux. The windows application 
for settings remains the same though. There will also be a drill template for the bottom board to easily lay out the components in there specific positions.
